Test Cases:

Case 1: Normal Operation

Input	Expected Behaviour
TrainDetected = TRUE	%M0.0 set to TRUE, all outputs activate
GateClosed = TRUE	%M0.1 set to TRUE, systems proceed
TrainDeparted = TRUE	%M0.0 set to FALSE, all outputs activate
GateClosed = FALSE	%M0.1 set to FALSE, systems proceed


Case 2: Gate Closure Failure

Input	Expected Behaviour
TrainDetected = TRUE	%M0.0 set to TRUE, all outputs activate
GateClosed = False	%M0.1 remains at false, emergency measures activate

Case 3: Gate Opening Failure

Input	Expected Behaviour
TrainDetected = TRUE	%M0.0 set to TRUE, all outputs activate
GateClosed = TRUE	%M0.1 set to TRUE, systems proceed
TrainDeparted = TRUE	%M0.0 set to FALSE, all outputs activate
GateClosed = TRUE	%M0.1 remains true, emergency measure activates

Case 4: Early departure input

Input	Actual Behaviour	Expected Behaviour
TrainDetected = TRUE	%M0.0 set to TRUE, all outputs activate	
GateClosed = TRUE	%M0.1 set to TRUE, systems proceed	
TrainDeparted = TRUE	%M0.0 set to FALSE, all outputs activate	Input should be ignored until certain
GateClosed = FALSE	%M0.1 set to FALSE, systems proceed
